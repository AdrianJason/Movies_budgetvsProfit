# **Movies: To Spend or Not To Spend**

##** Does a movie's budget have an impact a movie's outcome, gross income or rating?**

To figure out weather or not there is a relationship between a movie's gross income and that movie's production budget there were questions that needed to be answered. These questions were developed in order to look directly at the budget vs income relationship, but also to look at other factors that may have an impact on a movie's income. The questions are as the precide below along with the correlating notebook.

### Is there a correlation between a movie's budget and the domestic/worldwide gross?

### How does a production's budget break down in per genre, and does have an impact on the worldwide or domestic gross?

### Will a movie's production budget be reflected in the ratings of that movie? (budgetandratings.ipynb) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When reviewing the data, we initially wanted to identify the movies with the highest IMDB ratings and the ones with the lowest IMDB ratings and then compare how the budgets for each data set identified. Within the data compiled, there was 12 movies identified as having an IMDB rating of equal or greater than 8.3 and each movie had an average budget of roughly 140 million dollars. The highest rated movie per the data compiled was The Dark Knight which had a production budget of 185 million dollars and achieved a 9.0 IMDB rating.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely there was 7 movies identified as having an IMDB rating equal or less than 5.5 and each movie had an average budget of roughly 84 million dollars. The lowest rated movie per the data complied was The Twilight Saga: New Moon which had a production budget of 50 million dollars and achieved a 4.6 IMDB rating.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We then wanted to identify the movies with the highest and lowest production budgets and then compare how their IMDB ratings were. Within the data compiled, there was 12 movies identified as having a production budget of 230 million dollars or higher. Each movie had an average budget of roughly 281 million dollars and an average IMDB rating of 7.35. In terms of the lowest production budgets, there was 13 films identified as having a production budget of 12 million dollars or less. Each movie had an average budget of roughly 7.7 million dollars and an average IMDB rating of 7.08.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based upon the information compiled we can confirm that there is a correlation with the production budget of a film and their ratings. An interesting observation was the highest budget film, Pirates of the Carribbean: On Stranger Tides had a production budget of 379 million dollars and only obtained a 6.7 IMDB rating; however, the lowest production budget film of The Full Monty obtained a 7.2 IMDB rating with a production budget of only 3.5 million dollars.

### Does the director affect the gross outcome or does the budget? (directors.ipynb)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based upon the analysis that was done it can be said that the number of movies that a director has done, or the director’s experience, does affect the gross domestic outcome more so than the production budget, but only to a point. That point happens to be when the average budget decreases and outweighs the director’s experience. In the worldwide gross does not appear to be affected by a director's experience, but does have the same result as the gross domestic. As the average budget decreases there is a higher likelihood of a high percent change. It is understandable for there to be a difference between the gross domestic and worldwide outcome. Majority of the movies and directors on this dataset are English speaking and/or American movies. On the domestic (American) side these directors would be known in the United States and would probably be sought out. Worldwide, these directors might not be known, so the director wouldn’t affect the gross outcome. Overall, yes, the direct does affect the gross outcome domestically, but it does not worldwide.

### Is there a difference among studios and the production budget?
